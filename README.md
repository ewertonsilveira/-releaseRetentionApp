# Tech
Was built using the following tech and packages
- `node =>14.17`
- `Typescript 4.5`
- `prettier`
- `eslint`
- `jest`



## Assumptions and Additional Informations
- I assumed we would have an API to fetch the deployment, project, etc data
- I created the class to encapsulate the release data and the retention behaviour
- I assmed the shape of the data to be flattened and denormalized 

### Run Tests

To run test, run the command line `yarn test`. 

To run test in watch mode, run the command line `yarn test:watch`.
